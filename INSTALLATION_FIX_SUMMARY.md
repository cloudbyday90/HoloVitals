# Installation Script Fix - v1.4.1

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the installation script to properly accept interactive user input by changing from piped execution to downloaded execution method.

## Problem
The original installation command used:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudbyday90/HoloVitals/main/scripts/install-v1.4.1.sh | bash
```

When piping to bash, the script cannot read from stdin, preventing interactive prompts for:
- Domain name
- Admin email
- Cloudflare Tunnel token

## Solution
Changed to wget-based execution:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudbyday90/HoloVitals/main/scripts/install-v1.4.1.sh && chmod +x install-v1.4.1.sh && ./install-v1.4.1.sh
```

This approach:
1. Downloads the script to a file
2. Makes it executable
3. Runs it directly (not piped), allowing stdin access

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Installation Script
- Modified `scripts/install-v1.4.1.sh` header comment
- Script now works correctly with wget method
- All interactive prompts function properly

### 2. Updated Documentation
Updated installation command in:
- `RELEASE_NOTES_V1.4.1.md`
- `V1.4.1_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
- `release-body-v1.4.1.md`
- `V1.4.1_RELEASE_COMPLETE.md`
- `todo.md`

### 3. Updated GitHub Release
- Release v1.4.1 notes updated with correct installation command
- Release URL: https://github.com/cloudbyday90/HoloVitals/releases/tag/v1.4.1

## Verification
✅ Script downloaded and made executable
✅ Interactive prompts work correctly
✅ All documentation updated
✅ GitHub release updated
✅ Changes committed and pushed to main branch

## Installation Command (Corrected)
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudbyday90/HoloVitals/main/scripts/install-v1.4.1.sh && chmod +x install-v1.4.1.sh && ./install-v1.4.1.sh
```

## Technical Details

### Why Piping Fails
When using `curl | bash`:
- Bash reads the script from stdin
- No stdin available for the script's `read` commands
- Interactive prompts fail silently or hang

### Why Wget Works
When using `wget && ./script.sh`:
- Script is saved to a file
- Executed directly with full stdin access
- Interactive prompts work normally

- **Message**: "Fix installation script: Use wget method instead of piping to bash"

## Next Steps for Users
Users can now run the installation command and will be properly prompted for:
1. Domain name (with validation)
2. Admin email (with format validation)
3. Cloudflare Tunnel token (required)

The script will then proceed with automated installation including:
- Repository cloning
- Dependency installation
- Environment configuration
- Prisma client generation
- Cloudflare Tunnel setup
- Application build
