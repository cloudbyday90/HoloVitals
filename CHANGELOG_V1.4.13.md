# Changelog - HoloVitals v1.4.13

## Release Date
October 4, 2025

## Version
1.4.13

## Type
Bug Fix Release

---

## Overview
This release fixes a critical build error where payment API routes were being statically rendered during the build process, causing the build to fail with "Failed to collect page data" errors.

---

## Bug Fixes

### Payment Routes Static Rendering Issue
**Problem**: Build process failed when trying to statically render payment API routes during build time.

**Error Message**:
```
Error: Failed to collect page data for /api/payments/create-checkout-session
```

**Root Cause**: Payment API routes were missing the `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` declaration, causing Next.js to attempt static rendering during build time. Since these routes require runtime authentication and Stripe API calls, they cannot be statically rendered.

**Solution**: Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to all payment-related API routes to force dynamic rendering at request time.

**Files Modified**:
1. `app/api/payments/create-checkout-session/route.ts`
2. `app/api/payments/create-billing-portal/route.ts`
3. `app/api/payments/invoices/route.ts`
4. `app/api/payments/payment-methods/route.ts`
5. `app/api/payments/subscription/route.ts`
6. `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`

**Impact**: 
- ✅ Build process now completes successfully
- ✅ Payment routes render dynamically at request time
- ✅ No impact on runtime functionality
- ✅ Consistent with other dynamic API routes in the application

---

## Technical Details

### Code Changes

Each payment route now includes the dynamic rendering directive:

```typescript
// Force dynamic rendering to prevent build-time static generation
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
```

This directive ensures that:
1. Routes are not pre-rendered during build
2. Authentication checks happen at request time
3. Stripe API calls are made at runtime
4. Session data is properly accessed

### Routes Updated

| Route | Purpose | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `/api/payments/create-checkout-session` | Create Stripe checkout session | ✅ Fixed |
| `/api/payments/create-billing-portal` | Create billing portal session | ✅ Fixed |
| `/api/payments/invoices` | Retrieve customer invoices | ✅ Fixed |
| `/api/payments/payment-methods` | Manage payment methods | ✅ Fixed |
| `/api/payments/subscription` | Manage subscriptions | ✅ Fixed |
| `/api/webhooks/stripe` | Handle Stripe webhooks | ✅ Fixed |

## Compatibility

### Breaking Changes
None - This is a build-time fix with no runtime changes.

### Backward Compatibility
✅ Fully backward compatible with v1.4.12

### Migration Required
No migration required - update and rebuild.

---

## Testing

### Build Testing
```bash
npm run build
```
**Expected Result**: Build completes successfully without "Failed to collect page data" errors.

### Runtime Testing
All payment functionality should work identically to v1.4.12:
- ✅ Checkout session creation
- ✅ Billing portal access
- ✅ Invoice retrieval
- ✅ Payment method management
- ✅ Subscription management
- ✅ Webhook processing

## Related Issues

### Previous Similar Fixes
- v1.4.5: Fixed `/api/documents/upload` static rendering
- v1.4.7: Fixed 9 payment routes static rendering
- v1.4.12: Fixed `/api/chat` and `/api/dev-chat` static rendering

### Pattern Established
All API routes that require:
- Runtime authentication
- External API calls
- Session access
- Database operations

Should include `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to prevent build-time rendering.
