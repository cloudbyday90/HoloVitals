# Complete Text Contrast Fix - Final Report

## Date: October 1, 2025

---

## Issue Reported

**Problem**: The main dashboard was still using faded light gray text that was barely visible, particularly:
- "Welcome back!" heading
- "Cost Savings" title
- Other card titles
- Various text elements

---

## Complete Solution Applied

### Phase 1: Automated Global Replacement ✅
**Script**: `scripts/fix-text-contrast.sh`

**Changes**:
- `text-gray-500` → `text-gray-700` (40% darker)
- `text-gray-600` → `text-gray-800` (33% darker)
- `text-gray-400` → `text-gray-600` (50% darker)

**Impact**: 180+ instances updated across 26 files

---

### Phase 2: Component-Level Fixes ✅

**Card Component** (`components/ui/card.tsx`):
- Added default `text-gray-900` to CardTitle
- Changed CardDescription from `text-muted-foreground` to `text-gray-700`
- Ensures all card titles are dark by default

**Dashboard Page** (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`):
- Added `text-gray-900` to "Welcome back!" heading
- Added `text-gray-900` to "Cost Savings" title
- Added `text-gray-900` to "Quick Actions" title
- Added `text-gray-900` to "Recent Activity" title
- Added `text-gray-900` to "System Status" title

---

### Phase 3: Global CSS Rules ✅

**Added to** `app/globals.css`:

```css
/* Ensure all text is dark and readable by default */
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  color: #111827; /* gray-900 */
}

p, span, div {
  color: inherit;
}

/* Override any light text colors */
.text-muted-foreground {
  color: #374151 !important; /* gray-700 */
}
```

**Benefits**:
- All headings default to dark gray-900
- Overrides any light muted colors
- Ensures consistency across the app
