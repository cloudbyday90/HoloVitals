# 🐛 HoloVitals v1.4.5 - API Route Build Fix

## Bug Fix Release - Application Now Builds Successfully

This release fixes a build error that occurred when Next.js tried to pre-render the documents upload API route.

---

## 🔧 Fixed Issue

### Build Error with Documents Upload API

**Problem:** Build failed during Phase 7 (Build Application)  
**Error:**
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './test/data/05-versions-space.pdf'
Build error occurred
[Error: Failed to collect page data for /api/documents/upload]
```

**Root Cause:** Next.js attempted to statically pre-render the upload API route during build  
**Solution:** Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to prevent static rendering  
**Impact:** Application now builds successfully ✅

## 🚀 One-Line Installation

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudbyday90/HoloVitals/main/scripts/install-v1.4.5.sh && chmod +x install-v1.4.5.sh && ./install-v1.4.5.sh
```

---

## 📊 The Fix

Added dynamic rendering configuration to the upload route:

```typescript
// Force dynamic rendering for this route
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
```

This tells Next.js to:
- Skip static analysis during build
- Always render this route dynamically at request time
- Not attempt to pre-render or cache the route
