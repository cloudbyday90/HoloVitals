# HoloVitals v1.4.2 Release Notes

## 🐛 Bug Fix Release - Installation Script Improvements

**Release Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Version:** 1.4.2  
**Type:** Bug Fix Release

---

## 📋 Overview

Version 1.4.2 is a bug fix release that addresses critical issues with the installation script discovered during testing. This release contains no application code changes - only improvements to the installation process.

---

## 🔧 What's Fixed

### Installation Script Issues

#### Issue 1: Interactive Input Not Working
**Problem:** When using `curl | bash`, the script couldn't read user input for domain, email, and Cloudflare token.

**Solution:** Changed installation method to download the script first, then execute it directly.

**Impact:** Users can now properly interact with installation prompts.

---

#### Issue 2: Non-Git Directory Error
**Problem:** Script failed when HoloVitals directory existed but wasn't a git repository (from previous failed installations).

**Error Message:**
```
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```

**Solution:** Added validation to check if existing directory is a git repository. If not, the script removes it and clones fresh.

**Impact:** Script now recovers gracefully from failed installations.

---

#### Issue 3: Package.json Not Found
**Problem:** Script was checking out v1.4.1 tag which only contained documentation files, not the actual application code.

**Error Message:**
```
npm error code ENOENT
npm error path /tmp/holovitals-test/HoloVitals/package.json
npm error errno -2
npm error enoent Could not read package.json
```

**Solution:** Changed script to use main branch and navigate to `medical-analysis-platform` subdirectory where the actual application code resides.

**Impact:** Script now correctly finds and installs all application dependencies.
