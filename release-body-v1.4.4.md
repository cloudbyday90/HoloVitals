# 🐛 HoloVitals v1.4.4 - Smart Installation with Skip Checks

## Bug Fix Release - Intelligent Component Detection

This release adds smart detection to the installation script, allowing it to skip already installed components and prevent service conflicts.

---

## 🔧 Fixed Issue

### Installation Service Conflicts

**Problem:** Installation failed when components were already installed  
**Error:**
```
Error: An origin certificate already exists for this hostname
systemd service conflict
```

**Root Cause:** Script tried to reinstall/reconfigure already running services  
**Solution:** Added intelligent detection for all major phases  
**Impact:** Installation can be safely re-run without errors ✅

## 🎯 New Smart Checks

### 1. Dependencies Detection (Phase 3)
- Checks if `node_modules` exists
- Prompts to reinstall or skip
- Saves time on re-runs

### 2. Prisma Client Detection (Phase 5)
- Checks if Prisma client is generated
- Prompts to regenerate or skip
- Avoids unnecessary regeneration

### 3. Cloudflare Tunnel Detection (Phase 6)
- Checks if service is already running
- **Automatically skips** if active
- Prevents service conflicts

### 4. Build Detection (Phase 7)
- Checks if `.next` directory exists
- Prompts to rebuild or skip
- Saves time when build is current
