## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Interactive Input Not Working ✅
- **Problem:** `curl | bash` prevented stdin access for user prompts
- **Solution:** Changed to wget-based download and execution
- **Impact:** Users can now properly enter domain, email, and Cloudflare token

### Issue 2: Non-Git Directory Error ✅
- **Problem:** Script failed when HoloVitals directory existed but wasn't a git repository
- **Error:** `fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git`
- **Solution:** Added validation to check if directory is a git repo, removes and re-clones if not
- **Impact:** Script recovers gracefully from failed installations

### Issue 3: Package.json Not Found ✅
- **Problem:** Script checked out v1.4.1 tag which only had documentation, not application code
- **Error:** `npm error enoent Could not read package.json`
- **Solution:** Use main branch and navigate to `medical-analysis-platform` subdirectory
- **Impact:** Script now correctly finds and installs all 1016 dependencies
