## 🔧 Fixed Issue

### Build Error with Payment API Routes

**Problem:** Build failed during Phase 7 (Build Application)  
**Error:**
```
Error: Neither authOptions nor config.authenticationOptions provided
Build error occurred
[Error: Failed to collect page data for /api/payments/create-billing-portal]
```

**Root Cause:** Next.js attempted to statically pre-render payment/subscription routes during build  
**Solution:** Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to 9 API routes  
**Impact:** Application now builds successfully ✅
