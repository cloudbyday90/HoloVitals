# 🐛 HoloVitals v1.4.6 - Private Repository Authentication

## Bug Fix Release - GitHub PAT Support

This release adds GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) authentication to support cloning and updating the private HoloVitals repository.

---

## 🔧 Fixed Issue

### Private Repository Access

**Problem:** Installation failed because repository is private  
**Error:**
```
fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': terminal prompts disabled
fatal: Authentication failed
```

**Root Cause:** Repository is private and requires authentication  
**Solution:** Added GitHub PAT prompt and authenticated git operations  
**Impact:** Installation now works with private repositories ✅

---

## 🚀 One-Line Installation

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudbyday90/HoloVitals/main/scripts/install-v1.4.6.sh && chmod +x install-v1.4.6.sh && ./install-v1.4.6.sh
```

---

## 🔐 Before You Install

### Create GitHub Personal Access Token

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. **Click:** "Generate new token (classic)"
3. **Name:** "HoloVitals Installation"
4. **Select scope:** ✅ **repo** (Full control of private repositories)
5. **Generate and copy** the token immediately!

---

## 📝 New Configuration Prompt

The installer now prompts for:

1. Domain name
2. Admin email
3. Cloudflare Tunnel token
4. **GitHub Personal Access Token (NEW)**

---

## 🔐 How It Works

**Authenticated Git Operations:**
```bash
# Clone with authentication
git clone https://${GITHUB_PAT}@github.com/cloudbyday90/HoloVitals.git

# Pull with authentication
git pull https://${GITHUB_PAT}@github.com/cloudbyday90/HoloVitals.git main
```

**Security:**
- PAT stored in memory only
- Not written to disk
- Discarded when script completes

---

- ✅ Phase 3: Dependencies Installation (with smart check)
