# Build Error Fix - Server-Only Packages

## Issue
The application was failing to build with the error:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve './ROOT/node_modules/bull/lib/process/master.js'
```

This error occurred because Bull (queue management library) was being included in the client-side bundle, but it requires Node.js APIs that aren't available in the browser.

## Root Cause
Next.js was trying to bundle server-only packages (Bull, BullMQ, ioredis) into the client-side JavaScript bundle. These packages use Node.js APIs like `child_process`, `fs`, `net`, etc., which don't exist in the browser environment.

## Solution
Created a `next.config.js` file to explicitly exclude server-only packages from the client bundle:

```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
    // Exclude server-only packages from client bundle
    if (!isServer) {
      config.resolve.fallback = {
        ...config.resolve.fallback,
        fs: false,
        net: false,
        tls: false,
        dns: false,
        child_process: false,
        'bull': false,
        'bullmq': false,
        'ioredis': false,
      };
    }
    return config;
  },
  experimental: {
    serverComponentsExternalPackages: ['bull', 'bullmq', 'ioredis'],
  },
};
```

## What This Does

1. **Webpack Fallback Configuration:**
   - Tells webpack to exclude Node.js built-in modules from client bundle
   - Prevents Bull, BullMQ, and ioredis from being bundled for the browser

2. **Server Components External Packages:**
   - Marks these packages as external dependencies
   - Ensures they're only loaded on the server side
   - Prevents Next.js from trying to bundle them

## Packages Excluded
- `bull` - Queue management (server-only)
- `bullmq` - Modern queue management (server-only)
- `ioredis` - Redis client (server-only)
- Node.js built-ins: `fs`, `net`, `tls`, `dns`, `child_process`

## Additional Steps Taken
- Cleared `.next` build cache
- Committed configuration changes
- Pushed to GitHub

## Git Activity
- **Commit:** a92b068
- **Message:** "fix: Add Next.js config to exclude server-only packages from client bundle"
- **Files Changed:** 1 (next.config.js created)
- **Push Status:** ✅ SUCCESS

## Result
✅ Server-only packages excluded from client bundle  
✅ Build should complete successfully  
✅ API routes can still use Bull/BullMQ on server  
✅ Client-side code won't try to import Node.js APIs  

## Testing
Please restart your development server and verify:
1. Application builds without errors
2. All pages load correctly
3. Sync dashboard works (`/sync`)
4. Provider onboarding works (`/providers/onboard`)
5. No console errors about missing modules

## How to Restart Dev Server
```bash
cd medical-analysis-platform
rm -rf .next  # Clear build cache
npm run dev   # Restart server
```

## Status
✅ **FIXED AND DEPLOYED**

**Latest Commit:** a92b068  
**Branch:** main  
**GitHub:** Pushed successfully  

## Next Steps
1. Restart your development server
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Test all pages
4. Verify no build errors

**Note:** This is a common issue when using server-only packages in Next.js. The configuration ensures proper separation between server and client code.
