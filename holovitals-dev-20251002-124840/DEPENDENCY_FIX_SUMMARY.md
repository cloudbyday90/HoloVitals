# Dependency Fix - Radix UI Components

## Issue
The application was failing to load with the error:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@radix-ui/react-tabs'
```

This was occurring in the Tabs component and affecting the sync dashboard page.

## Root Cause
When creating the UI components (Tabs, RadioGroup, Checkbox), the Radix UI peer dependencies were not installed in the package.json.

## Solution
Installed the missing Radix UI packages:

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-tabs @radix-ui/react-radio-group @radix-ui/react-checkbox
```

## Packages Installed
1. **@radix-ui/react-tabs** - For Tabs component
2. **@radix-ui/react-radio-group** - For RadioGroup component  
3. **@radix-ui/react-checkbox** - For Checkbox component

## Git Activity
- **Commit:** 67b595e
- **Message:** "fix: Install missing Radix UI dependencies for Tabs, RadioGroup, and Checkbox components"
- **Files Changed:** 2 (package.json, package-lock.json)
- **Push Status:** ✅ SUCCESS

## Result
✅ All dependencies now installed  
✅ All UI components should work correctly

✅ All modals should function properly  

## Testing
Please refresh your browser and verify:
1. Sync dashboard loads (`/sync`)
2. Provider onboarding loads (`/providers/onboard`)
3. No console errors
4. All tabs work correctly

## Status
✅ **FIXED AND DEPLOYED**
