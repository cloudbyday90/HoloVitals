## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### API Route Build Error ✅

**Problem:** Build failed during Phase 7 when Next.js tried to pre-render the documents upload API route.

**Error Message:**
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './test/data/05-versions-space.pdf'
at __TURBOPACK__module__evaluation__ (.next/server/chunks/[turbopack]_runtime.js:73:12)
...
Build error occurred
[Error: Failed to collect page data for /api/documents/upload]
```

**Root Cause:** Next.js attempted to statically analyze and pre-render the `/api/documents/upload` route during build time. Since this route handles file uploads and imports the OCR service, Next.js tried to access test data files that don't exist in the build environment.

**Solution:** Added dynamic rendering configuration to the upload route:

```typescript
// Force dynamic rendering for this route
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
```

**Impact:** Application now builds successfully without file access errors ✅

---

## 📊 The Fix Explained

### What Changed

**File:** `medical-analysis-platform/app/api/documents/upload/route.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { writeFile, mkdir } from 'fs/promises';
import { join } from 'path';
import { ocrService } from '@/lib/services/ocr.service';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // ... route handler
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { writeFile, mkdir } from 'fs/promises';
import { join } from 'path';
import { ocrService } from '@/lib/services/ocr.service';

// Force dynamic rendering for this route
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // ... route handler
}
```

### Why This Works

The `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` directive tells Next.js to:

1. **Skip Static Analysis:** Don't try to analyze this route during build time
2. **Dynamic Rendering:** Always render this route at request time, not build time
3. **No Pre-rendering:** Don't attempt to pre-render or cache this route
4. **Runtime Only:** Only execute this code when an actual request comes in

This is the correct approach for API routes that:
- Handle file uploads
- Access external services
- Require runtime data
- Cannot be pre-rendered
- Need request-specific context
