### Files Created: 14 files, 4,000+ lines of code

## 🔄 Deployment Tasks (Required)

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
cd medical-analysis-platform

# Option A: Using Prisma (Recommended)
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate

# Option B: Using SQL directly
psql -U holovitals_user -d holovitals -f prisma/migrations/add_user_roles.sql
```

**Verify:**
```sql
-- Check if role column exists
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'User' AND column_name = 'role';

-- Check if AccessLog table exists
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'access_logs';
```

### 2. Set Owner Account
```sql
-- IMPORTANT: Replace with your actual email
UPDATE "User" SET "role" = 'OWNER' WHERE "email" = 'your-email@example.com';

-- Verify
SELECT id, email, role FROM "User" WHERE role = 'OWNER';
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Only ONE user should have OWNER role!

### 3. Install Dependencies (if needed)
```bash
cd medical-analysis-platform
npm install next-auth
```

### 4. Environment Variables
Ensure `.env` has:
```env
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
```

### 5. Build and Test
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test protected routes
# 1. Login as PATIENT → Try /dashboard/costs → Should be denied
# 2. Login as OWNER → Try /dashboard/costs → Should work
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [ ] PATIENT cannot access `/dashboard/costs`
- [ ] PATIENT cannot access `/dashboard/instances`
- [ ] PATIENT cannot access `/dashboard/queue`
- [ ] OWNER can access all routes
- [ ] ADMIN can access admin routes but not costs
- [ ] Access denied page displays correctly
- [ ] Sidebar shows/hides items based on role
- [ ] Lock icons appear on restricted menu items

### API Testing
```bash
# Test as PATIENT (should return 403)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/costs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer PATIENT_TOKEN"

# Test as OWNER (should return 200)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/costs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer OWNER_TOKEN"
```

### Database Testing
```sql
-- Check access logs are being created
SELECT * FROM "access_logs" ORDER BY "timestamp" DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check for failed access attempts
SELECT * FROM "access_logs" WHERE "allowed" = false ORDER BY "timestamp" DESC;

-- Check user roles
SELECT email, role FROM "User";
```

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Security Metrics
- [ ] 0 unauthorized access to financial data
- [ ] 100% of access attempts logged
- [ ] <1% false positive access denials
- [ ] 0 OWNER credential compromises

### Performance Metrics
- [ ] Access control checks <100ms
- [ ] No impact on page load times
- [ ] Audit log queries <500ms

### Compliance Metrics
- [ ] 100% audit trail coverage
- [ ] HIPAA compliance maintained
- [ ] Regular access log reviews completed
- [ ] All role changes documented

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: User can't access page they should have access to
**Solution:**
1. Check user role in database
2. Review access logs for denial reason
3. Verify role permissions in ROLE_PERMISSIONS
4. Clear user session and re-login

### Issue: Access logs not being created
**Solution:**
1. Verify AccessLog table exists
2. Check database connection
3. Review middleware execution
4. Check for errors in server logs

### Issue: Role changes not taking effect
**Solution:**
1. Clear user session (sign out)
2. Verify role in database
3. Check middleware is running
4. Restart development server
