{'role': 'user', 'content': 'We are not done, not by a long shot. Heh. Anyways, we are naming this project HoloVitals. Next, let us talk about repositories, as this will be a key component that will make this project different.\n\nThere will be a number of different repositories that will "house" various pieces of information for the platform and the patient. Let\'s start off with a couple, we will build the others as we continue our discussion.\n\nFirst is the AI Analysis Repository - This repository is the repository that is actively analyzing data. The repository will store the relevant pieces of information  (patient info, data to be analyzed, context, AI prompt, and other relevant information). This repository is seeking the missing piece of the "puzzle" that needs to be analyzed.\n\nAI Prompt Optimization Repository - This repository will optimize the current and future prompts needed for the AI Analysis Repository. It ensures that the prompts are relevant and optimized, to help with costs and other efficiencies, to make sure we obtain relevant information.\n\nAI Context Cache Repository - This repository will store and provide the AI Analysis repository the necessary context needed to properly analyze the required data. The Cache repository will pull relevant patient data, as well as any new input, and store the information into memory. The "cache" will be sorted in order of importance and actively re-analyzed after new results to ensure that the AI analysis repository does not receive confusing data and keeps it to the necessary information. To ensure we comply with HIPAA regulations, all PII and PIA information, and any other HIPAA violations, are removed from the cache.'}
