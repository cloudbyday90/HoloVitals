{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Between 2 and 3 on "How it Works" we are missing a few things. We will have the ability to "create" an account on our website. The patient can login and view their account, data, and their private information. This should be completely visible and transparent to the patient.\n\nHowever, this will not be accessible by the owner, developers, or anyone other than the patient. In rare cases, where there is a bug, the patient could provide consent to a specialist who needs to manually correct some pieces of information, and may need to see sensitive data. \n\nThe patient should provide explicit consent, and the access should be time-based. No information can be exported out of the controlled environment.  Controls should be put in place, as well as warnings, that could potentially cause unwarranted PHI or PII access.\n\nWe should also implement strict authentication procedures and enforce MFA requirements. \n'}
