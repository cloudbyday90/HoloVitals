{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Next, we need to work on the next repository, which is called the Patient Repository. Each user will have their own repository that is unique and sandboxed from other patients. Instead of having a central database of all patients, each repository will contain comprehensive data about the patient, including relevant data and stored context.\n\nData will include gender, age, diagnoses, bloodwork, etc. Each patient will be tied in, at least, three ways.  Would like some addtional recommendations here as well.\n\nDate of birth\nFull Name\nPlace of Birth\n\nIn order to curb the excess amount of data (multiple accounts, etc), a user will be tied to one repository. If the user wishes to create a different account, the previous repository is deleted AND purged entirely. Optionally, the user could opt to update (or migrate their accounts) to a new email/username. (Provided they can verify that the account belongs to them.'}
