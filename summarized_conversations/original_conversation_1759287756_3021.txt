{'role': 'user', 'content': 'We need to work on the costs for our platform. I am thinking of having a monthly cost  + additional token purchases (if needed). The initial onboarding will have a higher allotted token amount, followed by a monthly re-up on the user balance.\n\nThe platform should allow large files (up to 1gb) for large PDF exports from EHR platforms, such as Epic.  Our platform should ingest the data and a cost analysis should be performed.\n\nThe user could opt for a higher teir, or a one-time charge for larger files. Optionally, the user can opt to keep the current tier, but the ingest process could take multiple months, up to their token balance.\n\nThe lower tier should have a 10mb "free" initial upload limit. The first initial upload, up to 10mb, should NOT count towards their total token balance, up to the 10 mb limit. Larger sizes will count.\n\nThe middle tier should have a 25mb initial "free" upload limit. The first initial upload, up to 25mb, should NOT count towards their total token balance, up to the 10 mb limit. The middle tier should have a higher token deposit.\n\nThe higher tier should have an initial "free" upload limit of 100mb. Similar wording as above.'}
