{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Okay, we need a new repository called "HIPAA Compliance Repository." This repository is dedicated to understanding HIPAA rules and laws in general. Additionally, it seeks to understand how to apply HIPAA to our current platform, ensuring we remain compliant.\n\n Lastly, it will pull random logs and perform audits on actions performed on the platform. Also, if any of the other repositories needs clarification on any potential HIPAA violation, it will wait until the HIPAA repository will complete its analysis before it moves forward. \n\nIf there is a conflict, the owner and/or developer can work to figure out a path forward, even making development changes.\n '}
