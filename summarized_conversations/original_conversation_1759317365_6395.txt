{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '# Starting Cerner-Specific Features Implementation\n\nPerfect! I\'ll implement Cerner-specific features similar to what we did for Epic and Allscripts. Cerner (now Oracle Health) has **25% US market share** - the 2nd largest EHR provider. Combined with Epic and Allscripts, we\'ll reach **64% market coverage**!\n\nLet me start by creating a comprehensive plan and then implementing the features.\n\n<function_calls>\n<str-replace file_path="todo.md">\n<old_str>**Status**: 45% Complete (Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 2b + Phase 4 done)  \n**Current Phase**: Ready for next phase\n**Estimated Time**: 2 weeks remaining</old_str>\n<new_str>**Status**: 45% Complete (Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 2b + Phase 4 done)  \n**Current Phase**: Phase 2c - Cerner-Specific Features\n**Estimated Time**: 2 weeks remaining</new_str>\n</str-replace>\n</function_calls>'}
