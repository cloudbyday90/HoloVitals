{'role': 'user', 'content': 'We are building a website, a lot like Doctronic, but with sophisticated medical analysis and AI processing capabilities. This website will use OCR to examine PDF documents, such as after-care summaries, bloodwork panel results, and other imaging results.\r\n\r\nInstead of relying exclusively on user-provided data, we want to cross-reference existing documents and results to help drive decisions and provide accurate context for the AI agents. We need to ensure we maintain context as we develop our application.'}
