{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Okay, now we need to work on the user interface. I would prefer an open design instead of a closed ecosystem with a bunch of navigation options.\n\nthe interface should be simple with an AI chat bot. There should be an on-boarding process to enter in information about the patient. There should be a seperate section to upload documents, such as PDFs. The AI chatbot will use a lower grade AI solultion. \n\nHowever, the analysis and other important tasks will use a large LLM that is HIPAA approved. My thought is using Azure (or whatever other cloud services that are HIPAA approved) that is spun up to do the work needed. \n\nWe will need a HIPAA-approved LLM, in addition to the HIPAA-approved cloud provider. The virtual instance is spun up to do the work, then de-provisioned until the next task.\n\nFor the context piece, we need to ensure that the AI prompts will allow the LLM to process using the available resources. For example, if the LLM is 8b or 12b, then the repository will optimize for the context window. In order to control costs, we will utilize the most efficient LLM (ie. Chatgpt 5, etc). \n\nIf the AI needs to split up the prompts to fit the context window, we can run different instances or have a que system.'}
