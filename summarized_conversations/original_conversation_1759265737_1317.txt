Notably, it demonstrates a 64% success rate in internal agentic coding evaluations, significantly higher than the 38% achieved by Claude 3 Opus [[Introducing Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet)].\n\nAdditional features:\n- **Artifacts**: A new interface feature allowing real-time editing of AI-generated content such as code and documents [[Introducing Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet)]\n- **Vision capabilities**: Enhanced image understanding, particularly for charts, graphs, and text extraction from visuals [[Introducing Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet)]\n- Safety compliance: Rated at **ASL-2** (Applied Safety Level 2) after rigorous red teaming and evaluation by the UK AI Safety Institute [[Introducing Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet)]\n\n> **Note**: Although a newer **Claude Sonnet 4.5** was announced on September 29, 2025 [[Claude Developer Platform](https://docs.claude.com/en/release-notes/api)], **Claude 3.5 Sonnet remains actively supported and widely used**, with a clear migration path provided by cloud providers like AWS [[Migrate from Anthropic\'s Claud...](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/migrate-from-anthropics-claude-3-5-sonnet-to-claude-4-sonnet-on-amazon-bedrock/)].\n\n---\n\n## Local LLM Option: Llama with Open WebUI\n\nAs an alternative to cloud-based models, deploying a **local LLM** such as **Llama 3.2** using **Open WebUI** provides a secure, private, and cost-effective solution—especially suitable for organizations requiring offline operation or data sovereignty.\n\n### Open WebUI Overview\n\n**Open WebUI** is a self-hosted, extensible, and user-friendly AI interface designed to operate entirely offline [[open-webui/open-webui: User-fr...](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui)]. It supports multiple backend LLM runners, including:\n- **Ollama** (most common)\n- **OpenAI API-compatible servers**\n- **llama.cpp**\n- **Hugging Face models**\n\nThe platform provides a ChatGPT-like web interface with support for persistent chats, model switching, and system prompts, making it ideal for enterprise and personal use [[open-webui/open-webui: User-fr...](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui)].\n\n### Setup and Integration Process\n\nTo deploy **Llama 3.2** locally using **Open WebUI** and **Ollama**:\n\n1. **Install Ollama**  \n   Ollama is an open-source tool that simplifies running LLMs locally. It supports GPU acceleration and model quantization for optimal performance [[Part 1: Getting Started with L...](https://medium.com/@able_wong/getting-started-with-local-ai-ollama-open-webui-part-1-bcaafcce6df7)].\n\n2. **Pull the Llama Model**  \n   Run:\n   ```bash\n   ollama pull llama3.2\n   ```\n   This downloads the model with optimized weights for your system [[Setting Up Llama 3.2 Locally w...](https://dev.to/raviagheda/setting-up-llama-32-locally-with-ollama-and-open-webui-a-complete-guide-3lcj)].\n\n3. **Deploy Open WebUI**  \n   Run Open WebUI via Docker:\n   ```bash\n   docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main\n   ```\n   This exposes the interface at `http://localhost:3000` [[A local AI setup using Ollama ...](https://www.emcken.dk/programming/2025/07/10/local-ai-setup-using-ollama-and-openwebui/)].\n\n4. **Connect to Ollama**  \n   Open WebUI automatically detects the local Ollama instance. The Llama 3.2 model becomes available for chat and API use.\n\n5. **API Access**  \n   Open WebUI exposes an **OpenAI-compatible API endpoint** at `http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions`, allowing seamless integration with existing AI client code [[A local AI setup using Ollama ...](https://www.emcken.dk/programming/2025/07/10/local-ai-setup-using-ollama-and-openwebui/)].\n\n> Guides from developers at **Jacob Emcken**, **DEV Community**, and **Reddit** confirm the stability and usability of this stack in 2025 [citations:18, 19, 24].\n\n### Benefits of Local Deployment\n\n- **Privacy**: No data leaves the local network [[open-webui/open-webui: User-fr...](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui)]\n- **Cost**: No per-token fees after initial setup\n- **Control**: Full access to model parameters and system prompts\n- **Extensibility**: Supports RAG, custom embeddings, and fine-tuning\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Roadmap\n\nTo integrate both cloud-based and local models into the AI Development Interface, the following steps are recommended:\n\n### 1. Update the `AIModel` Enum\n\nModify `lib/types/ai-provider.ts` to include the new models:\n```ts\nenum AIModel {\n  GPT_4O = "gpt-4o",\n  GPT_5 = "gpt-5",                     // [[Models - OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models)]\n  CLAUDE_3_SONNET = "claude-3-sonnet",\n  CLAUDE_3_5_SONNET = "claude-3-5-sonnet", // [[Introducing Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet)]\n  LLAMA_3_2_LOCAL = "llama3.2"          // [[Setting Up Llama 3.2 Locally w...](https://dev.to/raviagheda/setting-up-llama-32-locally-with-ollama-and-open-webui-a-complete-guide-3lcj)]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. Implement New Provider Classes\n\n#### `ChatGPT5Provider`\n- Extend the existing OpenAI provider\n- Use model ID: `"gpt-5"`\n- Support context length: 128,000 tokens [[Model - OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5-chat-latest)]\n- Implement response streaming and tool calling [[API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction)]\n\n#### `Claude35SonnetProvider`\n- Extend the Anthropic provider\n- Use model ID: `"claude-3-5-sonnet"`\n- Set maximum context: 200,000 tokens\n- Include vision support via image data in messages [[Introducing Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet)]\n\n#### `LocalLlamaProvider`\n- Communicate with Open WebUI’s API at `http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions`\n- Use OpenAI-compatible request format\n- Handle local authentication (none or custom key if enabled)\n\n---\n\n### 3. Register Providers in `ProviderManager`\n\nEnsure the service can dynamically select models:\n```ts\nconst providerManager = new ProviderManager();\nproviderManager.register(new ChatGPT5Provider(apiKey));\nproviderManager.register(new Claude35SonnetProvider(anthropicKey));\nproviderManager.register(new LocalLlamaProvider("http://localhost:3000"));\n```\n\nThis enables runtime switching between cloud and local models.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Test and Validate\n\n- **Unit tests**: Verify request/response formats for each model\n- **Performance benchmarks**: Compare latency, accuracy, and cost\n- **Failover logic**: Ensure graceful degradation if cloud APIs fail\n- **Security audit**: Validate API key handling and input sanitization\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe integration of **GPT-5 (ChatGPT 5)** and **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** into the service is not only feasible but strongly supported by current API availability and documentation from OpenAI and Anthropic [citations:1, 25]. Both models offer industry-leading capabilities in reasoning, coding, and multimodal processing.\n\nFurthermore, the use of **local LLMs** like **Llama 3.2** via **Open WebUI and Ollama** provides a powerful alternative for offline, secure, and customizable AI operations [citations:3, 18, 19]. This hybrid architecture—supporting both cloud and local models—ensures flexibility, scalability, and compliance with diverse user requirements.\n\nWith a clear implementation path involving updates to the model enum, provider classes, and the provider manager, the system can seamlessly adopt these newer models while maintaining extensibility for future advancements.'}
