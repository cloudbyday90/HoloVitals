{'role': 'user', 'content': "Let's work on integrating the repository system with existing services. I want to create another repository that is solely focused on development and enhancements. Also, another one that inputs, detects, and identifies bugs in the system.\n\nDevelopment and Enhancement Repository - This will use information provided by the user, developers, and self-identified bugs from the Bug Repository. This will build out a roadmap for future development and identify key areas for improvement. We will work on a separate repository for the Development and QA Processing Repository.\n\nBug Repository - created from user inputs, system detections, and methods. This will store known bugs that will be later fixed or addressed by the Development and QA Processing Repository. The Development and Enhancement Repository will use the data from the Bug Repository to adjust future feature updates and fixes.\n\nDevelopment and QA Processing Repository - This repository is any development project being actively worked on. We will need a Dev and QA environment that we can test bug fixes, feature updates/changes, and other code changes before being pushed to development. We will build out the mechanisms for testing and development at a later time. "}
