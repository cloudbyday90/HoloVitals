## Version 1.4.6 - Private Repository Authentication
**Release Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Type:** Bug Fix Release

---

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Private Repository Access

#### Issue
Installation script failed to clone the HoloVitals repository because it is private and requires authentication.

**Error:**
```
fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': terminal prompts disabled
fatal: Authentication failed
```

#### Root Cause
The repository is private and the installation script was attempting to clone without providing authentication credentials.

#### Solution
Added GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) prompt during configuration phase:

1. **Configuration Phase Enhancement:**
   - Added prompt for GitHub Personal Access Token
   - Provides instructions for creating a PAT
   - Validates that PAT is not empty

2. **Authenticated Git Operations:**
   - Uses PAT for cloning: `git clone https://${GITHUB_PAT}@github.com/...`
   - Uses PAT for pulling: `git pull https://${GITHUB_PAT}@github.com/...`
   - Ensures all git operations are authenticated

#### Impact
- Installation now works with private repositories
- Users can successfully clone and update the repository
- Secure authentication using GitHub PAT
