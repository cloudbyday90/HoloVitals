## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Private Repository Authentication ✅

**Problem:** Installation failed because the HoloVitals repository is private and requires authentication.

**Error Message:**
```
fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': terminal prompts disabled
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/cloudbyday90/HoloVitals.git/'
```

**Root Cause:** The repository is private and the installation script was attempting to clone without providing authentication credentials.

**Solution:** Added GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) authentication:

1. **Configuration Phase Enhancement:**
   - Added prompt for GitHub Personal Access Token
   - Provides clear instructions for creating a PAT
   - Validates that PAT is not empty
   - Displays helpful information about required scopes

2. **Authenticated Git Operations:**
   - Clone: `git clone https://${GITHUB_PAT}@github.com/cloudbyday90/HoloVitals.git`
   - Pull: `git pull https://${GITHUB_PAT}@github.com/cloudbyday90/HoloVitals.git main`
   - All git operations use the provided PAT

**Impact:** Installation now works successfully with private repositories ✅

## 🔐 GitHub PAT Implementation

### User Experience

**Prompt Display:**
```
⚠ GitHub Personal Access Token Required
The HoloVitals repository is private and requires authentication.
Create a PAT at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
Required scopes: repo (Full control of private repositories)

Enter GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT): [user input]
```

### Security Features

1. **Memory Only:** PAT is stored in a shell variable, never written to disk
2. **Session Scoped:** PAT is discarded when the script completes
3. **No Logging:** PAT is not logged or echoed to console
4. **Secure Transmission:** Uses HTTPS for all git operations

### Required PAT Scopes

- **repo** - Full control of private repositories
  - Includes: repo:status, repo_deployment, public_repo, repo:invite, security_events
  - Needed for: Cloning and pulling from private repository
