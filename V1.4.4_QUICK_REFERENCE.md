## 📋 What's New in v1.4.4

**Bug Fix Release** - Smart installation with skip checks

### New Features
- ✅ Detects already installed dependencies
- ✅ Detects generated Prisma client
- ✅ Detects running Cloudflare Tunnel service
- ✅ Detects existing application build
- ✅ Prompts user before reinstalling

---

## 🎯 Smart Detection

The installer now intelligently detects:

1. **Dependencies (Phase 3)**
   - Checks `node_modules` directory
   - Prompts: "Reinstall dependencies? (y/n)"

2. **Prisma Client (Phase 5)**
   - Checks if client is generated
   - Prompts: "Regenerate Prisma client? (y/n)"

3. **Cloudflare Tunnel (Phase 6)**
   - Checks if service is running
   - Auto-skips if already configured

4. **Application Build (Phase 7)**
   - Checks `.next` directory
   - Prompts: "Rebuild application? (y/n)"

## 🔧 Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fresh Installation

Script detects existing components and prompts before reinstalling.

### Scenario 3: Update After Code Changes
- Skip dependencies (if unchanged)
- Skip Prisma client (if schema unchanged)
- Skip Cloudflare Tunnel (already running)
- Rebuild application (to include changes)

### Scenario 4: Cloudflare Tunnel Already Running
Script automatically skips Phase 6, preventing service conflicts.
