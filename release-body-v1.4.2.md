# 🐛 HoloVitals v1.4.2 - Installation Script Bug Fixes

## Bug Fix Release - Installation Script Improvements

This release addresses critical issues with the installation script discovered during testing. **No application code changes** - only improvements to the installation process.

---

## 🔧 Fixed Issues

### 1. Interactive Input Not Working
**Problem:** Installation script couldn't read user input when piped to bash  
**Solution:** Changed to wget-based installation method  
**Impact:** Users can now properly enter domain, email, and Cloudflare token

### 2. Non-Git Directory Error
**Problem:** Script failed when HoloVitals directory existed but wasn't a git repository  
**Solution:** Added validation and automatic cleanup  
**Impact:** Script recovers gracefully from failed installations

### 3. Package.json Not Found
**Problem:** Script was checking out wrong tag without application code  
**Solution:** Use main branch and navigate to correct subdirectory  
**Impact:** Script now correctly installs all dependencies
