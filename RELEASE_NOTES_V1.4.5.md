# HoloVitals v1.4.5 Release Notes

## 🐛 Bug Fix Release - API Route Build Fix

**Release Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Version:** 1.4.5  
**Type:** Bug Fix Release

---

## 📋 Overview

Version 1.4.5 fixes a build error that occurred when Next.js tried to pre-render the documents upload API route. This release ensures the application builds successfully by configuring the route for dynamic rendering.

---

## 🔧 What's Fixed

### Build Error with Documents Upload API

**Problem:** Build process failed during Phase 7 (Build Application)

**Error Message:**
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './test/data/05-versions-space.pdf'
at __TURBOPACK__module__evaluation__ (.next/server/chunks/[turbopack]_runtime.js:73:12)
...
Build error occurred
[Error: Failed to collect page data for /api/documents/upload]
```

**Root Cause:** Next.js attempted to statically analyze and pre-render the `/api/documents/upload` route during build time. Since this route handles file uploads and imports the OCR service, Next.js tried to access test data files that don't exist in the build environment.

**Solution:** Added dynamic rendering configuration to the upload route.

**Impact:** Application now builds successfully without file access errors.

## 🚀 Installation

### One-Line Installation

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudbyday90/HoloVitals/main/scripts/install-v1.4.5.sh && chmod +x install-v1.4.5.sh && ./install-v1.4.5.sh
```

The installer will:
- Prompt for domain, email, and Cloudflare token
- Detect already installed components (smart checks from v1.4.4)
- Build application successfully

## 📊 Technical Details

### The Fix

**Before (v1.4.4):**
```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { writeFile, mkdir } from 'fs/promises';
import { join } from 'path';
import { ocrService } from '@/lib/services/ocr.service';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // ... route handler
}
```

**After (v1.4.5):**
```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { writeFile, mkdir } from 'fs/promises';
import { join } from 'path';
import { ocrService } from '@/lib/services/ocr.service';

// Force dynamic rendering for this route
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // ... route handler
}
```

### Why This Works

The `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` directive tells Next.js to:
- Skip static analysis during build
- Always render this route dynamically at request time
- Not attempt to pre-render or cache the route

This is appropriate for API routes that:
- Handle file uploads
- Access external services at runtime
- Require request-specific data
- Cannot be pre-rendered
