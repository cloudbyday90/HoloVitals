# HoloVitals v1.4.13 Release Notes

## 🚀 Release Information

**Version**: 1.4.13  
**Release Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Type**: Bug Fix Release  
**Priority**: High (Build Failure Fix)

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

HoloVitals v1.4.13 is a critical bug fix release that resolves a build failure affecting payment API routes. This release ensures the application builds successfully by forcing dynamic rendering for all payment-related endpoints.

**Key Fix**: Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to 6 payment API routes to prevent build-time static rendering errors.

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Critical: Payment Routes Build Failure

**Issue**: Build process failed with error:
```
Error: Failed to collect page data for /api/payments/create-checkout-session
```

**Impact**: 
- ❌ Application could not be built
- ❌ Deployment blocked
- ❌ Development workflow interrupted

**Resolution**:
- ✅ Added dynamic rendering directive to all payment routes
- ✅ Build now completes successfully
- ✅ All payment functionality preserved
- ✅ No runtime changes required

**Routes Fixed**:
1. `/api/payments/create-checkout-session` - Stripe checkout session creation
2. `/api/payments/create-billing-portal` - Billing portal access
3. `/api/payments/invoices` - Invoice retrieval
4. `/api/payments/payment-methods` - Payment method management
5. `/api/payments/subscription` - Subscription management
6. `/api/webhooks/stripe` - Stripe webhook handling

---

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Code Modifications

Each affected route now includes:

```typescript
// Force dynamic rendering to prevent build-time static generation
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
```

**Why This Fix Works**:
- Payment routes require runtime authentication via NextAuth
- Stripe API calls must happen at request time
- Session data cannot be accessed during build
- Dynamic rendering ensures proper request-time execution

### Files Modified

| File | Lines Changed | Purpose |
|------|---------------|---------|
| `app/api/payments/create-checkout-session/route.ts` | +3 | Checkout session creation |
| `app/api/payments/create-billing-portal/route.ts` | +3 | Billing portal access |
| `app/api/payments/invoices/route.ts` | +3 | Invoice retrieval |
| `app/api/payments/payment-methods/route.ts` | +3 | Payment methods |
| `app/api/payments/subscription/route.ts` | +3 | Subscription management |
| `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` | +3 | Webhook processing |

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Build Still Fails

**If build fails after upgrade**:

1. **Clear build cache**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Reinstall dependencies**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Verify git pull**:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -1
   # Should show v1.4.13 commit
   ```

4. **Check file changes**:
   ```bash
   grep "export const dynamic" app/api/payments/*/route.ts
   # Should show 'force-dynamic' in all files
   ```

### Payment Routes Not Working

**If payment functionality fails**:

1. **Verify Stripe configuration**:
   ```bash
   grep STRIPE .env.local
   # Should show STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
   ```

2. **Check Stripe service**:
   - Verify Stripe keys are valid
   - Check Stripe dashboard for errors
   - Test with Stripe test mode

3. **Review logs**:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   # Check console for errors
   ```
