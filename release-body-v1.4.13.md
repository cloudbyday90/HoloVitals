# 🐛 HoloVitals v1.4.13 - Payment Routes Build Fix

## Critical Bug Fix Release

This release fixes a critical build failure affecting payment API routes that prevented the application from building successfully.

---

## 🔥 What's Fixed

### Build Failure on Payment Routes

**Error**:
```
Error: Failed to collect page data for /api/payments/create-checkout-session
```

**Solution**: Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to all payment routes to prevent build-time static rendering.

**Routes Fixed**:
- ✅ `/api/payments/create-checkout-session` - Checkout session creation
- ✅ `/api/payments/create-billing-portal` - Billing portal access
- ✅ `/api/payments/invoices` - Invoice retrieval
- ✅ `/api/payments/payment-methods` - Payment method management
- ✅ `/api/payments/subscription` - Subscription management
- ✅ `/api/webhooks/stripe` - Webhook processing

---

## 🚀 Quick Upgrade

```bash
cd /path/to/HoloVitals
git pull origin main
npm run build
npm run start
```

**Upgrade Time**: 2-5 minutes

---

## ✅ What's Working

- ✅ **Build Process**: Completes successfully without errors
- ✅ **Payment Routes**: All 6 routes render dynamically at runtime
- ✅ **Stripe Integration**: Full payment functionality preserved
- ✅ **Webhook Processing**: Stripe webhooks handled correctly
- ✅ **Authentication**: NextAuth session checks work properly

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Code Changes

Each payment route now includes:

```typescript
// Force dynamic rendering to prevent build-time static generation
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
```

**Why This Works**:
- Payment routes require runtime authentication
- Stripe API calls must happen at request time
- Session data cannot be accessed during build
- Dynamic rendering ensures proper request-time execution

### Files Modified

- `app/api/payments/create-checkout-session/route.ts`
- `app/api/payments/create-billing-portal/route.ts`
- `app/api/payments/invoices/route.ts`
- `app/api/payments/payment-methods/route.ts`
- `app/api/payments/subscription/route.ts`
- `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`

**Total**: 6 files, 18 lines added
