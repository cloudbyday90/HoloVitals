# Apply additional HIPAA features schema
npx prisma db push --schema=prisma/schema-hipaa-additional.prisma
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Create or update your `.env` file:

```env
# Encryption
MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-256-bit-hex-key-here

# Session Management
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret-here
SESSION_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=480

# Security

### 3. Initialize Services

```typescript
import { accessControlService } from '@/lib/services/AccessControlService';
import { dataRetentionService } from '@/lib/services/DataRetentionService';

// Initialize default roles
await accessControlService.initializeDefaultRoles();

// Initialize retention policies
await dataRetentionService.initializeDefaultPolicies();
```

### 4. Enable Middleware

```typescript
import { createAuditMiddleware } from '@/lib/middleware/auditMiddleware';
import { securityHeadersMiddleware } from '@/lib/middleware/securityMiddleware';

// Add to your Express app
app.use(securityHeadersMiddleware());
app.use(createAuditMiddleware({
  excludePaths: ['/health', '/metrics'],
  phiRoutes: ['/api/patients', '/api/lab-results'],
}));
```

### 5. Protect Routes with 2FA

```typescript
import { require2FA } from '@/lib/middleware/twoFactorMiddleware';

// Protect sensitive routes
app.get('/api/sensitive-data', 
  sessionValidationMiddleware(),
  require2FA(),
  async (req, res) => {
    // Route handler
  }
);
```
