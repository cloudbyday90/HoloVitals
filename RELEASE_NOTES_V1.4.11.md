## 🎯 What's New

### Complete Service Independence

**The Problem:**
- Previous versions required Stripe, SMTP, and OpenAI configuration during installation
- Installation failed if services weren't ready
- Forced users to set up services before they were needed
- Slowed down deployment and testing

**The Solution:**
- All external services are now completely optional
- Installation only requires infrastructure (domain, Cloudflare)
- Configure services post-install via admin console
- Application builds and runs without any service keys
