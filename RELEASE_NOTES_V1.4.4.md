# HoloVitals v1.4.4 Release Notes

## 🐛 Bug Fix Release - Smart Installation with Skip Checks

**Release Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Version:** 1.4.4  
**Type:** Bug Fix Release

---

## 📋 Overview

Version 1.4.4 adds intelligent skip checks to the installation script, allowing it to detect already installed components and skip unnecessary steps. This prevents service conflicts and makes re-installation much faster and safer.

---

## 🔧 What's Fixed

### Installation Script Improvements

**Problem:** Installation failed when components were already installed, particularly with Cloudflare Tunnel service conflicts.

**Error Messages:**
```
Error: An origin certificate already exists for this hostname
systemd service conflict
```

**Solution:** Added smart detection for all major installation phases.

---

## 🎯 New Smart Checks

### 1. Dependencies Check (Phase 3)
**Detection:** Checks if `node_modules` directory exists and has packages  
**Behavior:** Prompts user to reinstall or skip  
**Benefit:** Saves time when dependencies are already installed

### 2. Prisma Client Check (Phase 5)
**Detection:** Checks if Prisma client is already generated  
**Behavior:** Prompts user to regenerate or skip  
**Benefit:** Avoids unnecessary regeneration

### 3. Cloudflare Tunnel Check (Phase 6)
**Detection:** Checks if cloudflared service is already running  
**Behavior:** Automatically skips if service is active  
**Benefit:** Prevents service conflicts and certificate errors

### 4. Build Check (Phase 7)
**Detection:** Checks if `.next` directory exists  
**Behavior:** Prompts user to rebuild or skip  
**Benefit:** Saves time when build is already complete

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudbyday90/HoloVitals/main/scripts/install-v1.4.4.sh && chmod +x install-v1.4.4.sh && ./install-v1.4.4.sh
