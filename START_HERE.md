## ⚠️ Important Note: Terminology

**Issue Identified**: System uses "Patient View" but should use "Customer View"

**Why**: HoloVitals is a Medical AI Assistant platform, not a healthcare provider
- Users are customers, not patients
- No doctor-patient relationship
- No direct medical care

**Solution**: Quick fix documented in `QUICK_TERMINOLOGY_FIX.md` for v1.4.1
