import { PermissionService } from '@/lib/services/rbac/PermissionService';

const result = await PermissionService.checkPermission(

  'clinical.read.all'
);

if (result.granted) {
  // Allow access
}
```

```typescript
import { OnboardingService } from '@/lib/services/rbac/OnboardingService';

await OnboardingService.initializeOnboarding(

const token = await OnboardingService.sendInvitation('employee-id');
// Send token to employee via email
```

### Creating Audit Log
```typescript
import { AuditService } from '@/lib/services/rbac/AuditService';
