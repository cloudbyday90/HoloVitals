## Version 1.4.4 - Smart Installation with Skip Checks
**Release Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Type:** Bug Fix Release

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Installation Script Improvements - Skip Already Installed Components

#### Issue
Installation script failed when components were already installed or configured:
- Cloudflare Tunnel service already running caused installation failure
- Re-running installation would reinstall all dependencies unnecessarily
- No way to skip already completed phases

**Error Example:**
```
Error: An origin certificate already exists for this hostname
systemd service conflict
```

#### Solution
Added intelligent checks to skip already installed/configured components:

1. **Dependencies Check (Phase 3)**
   - Checks if `node_modules` exists and has packages
   - Prompts user to reinstall or skip
   - Saves time on re-runs

2. **Prisma Client Check (Phase 5)**
   - Checks if Prisma client is already generated
   - Prompts user to regenerate or skip
   - Avoids unnecessary regeneration

3. **Cloudflare Tunnel Check (Phase 6)**
   - Checks if cloudflared service is already running
   - Automatically skips configuration if service is active
   - Prevents service conflicts and certificate errors

4. **Build Check (Phase 7)**
   - Checks if `.next` directory exists (previous build)
   - Prompts user to rebuild or skip
   - Saves time on re-runs

#### Impact
- Installation can be safely re-run without errors
- Faster re-installation when updating
- No more service conflicts
- User control over which phases to re-execute
