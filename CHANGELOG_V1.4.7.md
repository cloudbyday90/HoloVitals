**Release Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Type:** Bug Fix Release

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Build Error - Payment and Subscription API Routes

#### Issue
Build process failed when trying to pre-render payment and subscription API routes:

**Error:**
```
Error: Neither authOptions nor config.authenticationOptions provided
Build error occurred
[Error: Failed to collect page data for /api/payments/create-billing-portal]
```

#### Root Cause
Next.js was attempting to statically pre-render 9 payment and subscription API routes during build time. These routes require runtime authentication and external service access (Stripe), causing build failures.

#### Solution
Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to all payment and subscription routes:

- `/api/payments/create-billing-portal`
- `/api/payments/create-checkout-session`
- `/api/payments/invoices`
- `/api/payments/payment-methods`
- `/api/payments/subscription`
- `/api/subscriptions/cancel`
- `/api/subscriptions`
- `/api/tokens/purchase`
- `/api/webhooks/stripe`

#### Impact
- Application now builds successfully
- All payment and subscription routes work correctly at runtime
- No more build-time authentication errors
