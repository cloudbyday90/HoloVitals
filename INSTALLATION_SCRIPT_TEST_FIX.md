# Installation Script Test & Fix - v1.4.1

## Issue Discovered During Testing
When testing the installation script in a clean environment, encountered an error when the HoloVitals directory already existed but was not a git repository.

## Error Message
```
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```

## Root Cause
The script checked if the `HoloVitals` directory existed and attempted to run `git pull` without verifying if it was actually a git repository. This caused the script to fail when:
- Directory existed from a previous failed installation
- Directory was created manually
- Directory was copied without .git folder

## Solution Implemented
Enhanced the repository setup logic to:
1. Check if HoloVitals directory exists
2. If it exists, verify it's a git repository (check for .git folder)
3. If it's a git repo, update it with `git pull`
4. If it's NOT a git repo, remove the directory and clone fresh

## Code Changes

### Before
```bash
if [ -d "HoloVitals" ]; then
    echo "HoloVitals directory exists, updating..."
    cd HoloVitals
    git pull origin main
else
    echo "Cloning HoloVitals repository..."
    git clone https://github.com/cloudbyday90/HoloVitals.git
    cd HoloVitals
fi
```

### After
```bash
if [ -d "HoloVitals" ]; then
    echo "HoloVitals directory exists..."
    cd HoloVitals
    # Check if it's a git repository
    if [ -d ".git" ]; then
        echo "Updating existing repository..."
        git pull origin main
    else
        echo "Directory exists but is not a git repository. Removing and cloning fresh..."
        cd ..
        rm -rf HoloVitals
        git clone https://github.com/cloudbyday90/HoloVitals.git
        cd HoloVitals
    fi
else
    echo "Cloning HoloVitals repository..."
    git clone https://github.com/cloudbyday90/HoloVitals.git
    cd HoloVitals
fi
```

## Benefits
- ✅ Handles existing non-git directories gracefully
- ✅ Prevents installation failures
- ✅ Ensures clean git repository for version checkout
- ✅ Provides clear user feedback about what's happening
- ✅ Allows script to recover from previous failed installations

## Testing Scenarios Covered
1. ✅ Fresh installation (no HoloVitals directory)
2. ✅ Update existing git repository
3. ✅ Handle non-git HoloVitals directory
4. ✅ Interactive prompts work correctly
