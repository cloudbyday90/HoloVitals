## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Routes Fixed (6 Total)

| Route | Purpose | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `/api/payments/create-checkout-session` | Stripe checkout | ✅ Fixed |
| `/api/payments/create-billing-portal` | Billing portal | ✅ Fixed |
| `/api/payments/invoices` | Invoice retrieval | ✅ Fixed |
| `/api/payments/payment-methods` | Payment methods | ✅ Fixed |
| `/api/payments/subscription` | Subscriptions | ✅ Fixed |
| `/api/webhooks/stripe` | Webhooks | ✅ Fixed |

### Code Pattern Applied

```typescript
// Force dynamic rendering to prevent build-time static generation
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
```

**Why This Works**:
- Prevents Next.js from attempting static rendering during build
- Forces runtime rendering for authentication-dependent routes
- Allows Stripe API calls at request time
- Enables proper session access
