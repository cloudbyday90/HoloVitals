- [ ] Audit logs
- [ ] Log search & filter
- [ ] Log export

### Testing Tools
- [ ] API testing interface

- [ ] Performance testing

## Phase 4: Shared Components
- [ ] Console layout with sidebar
- [ ] Data tables with sorting/filtering
- [ ] Charts and visualizations
- [ ] Export functionality
- [ ] Real-time updates (WebSocket)

## Phase 5: Security & Access Control
- [ ] Role-based route protection
- [ ] Audit logging for admin actions
- [ ] IP whitelisting (optional)
- [ ] Two-factor authentication for admins
- [ ] Session management

## Implementation Order
1. RBAC system (middleware, roles)
2. Admin Console - Dashboard
3. Admin Console - User Management
4. Admin Console - Financial Management
5. Dev Console - Error Monitoring
6. Dev Console - API Monitoring
7. Additional features as needed

## Estimated Time
- Phase 1: 1-2 hours
- Phase 2: 4-6 hours
- Phase 3: 3-4 hours
- Phase 4: 2-3 hours
- Phase 5: 1-2 hours

**Total: 11-17 hours of development**

## Next Steps
1. Start with RBAC system
2. Create admin console layout
3. Build dashboard with key metrics
4. Add user management
5. Continue with other features
